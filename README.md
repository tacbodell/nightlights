## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was made using NASA's Astronomical API. It pulls data from the API depending on the user's calendar input. The API supports dates all the way back to 1980!

## Lessons Learned:

API keys can be hard to find when you don't know where to look. Ultimately, they should be obtained only through places that are entirely trustworthy. Keys that cost money should not be considered unless the project will be a large-scale operation that will earn you money in return, as they are typically monthly subscriptions.
